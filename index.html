      <p>
        The idea of ZETSU is to be an app that adapts websites into app format, via modules. Offering all the extra features that ZETSU has which make the interaction for the users more appealing and complete. 
      </p>

      <p>
       Modules contain the instructions for the app to work, they manage to get the data from websites and draw the layout of ZETSU, which will vary depending on the website they have been made to.
      </p>

      <p>
        ZETSU doesn´t provide any modules nor promotes them.
       </p>
       
      <p>
       ZETSU by itself can´t do anything unless you load a module on it, modules make the app function (Modules are in JSON format).
      </p>

      <p>
        Modules can take advantage of the ZETSU video player, Image viewer, Text reader.
       </p>

      </p>
